This lab was a helpful one. I don't have that much experience debugging, but with VS Studio, it is a lot quicker to debug your code. Some problems with the code were simple spelling errors, which are very common.
The errors were found in the site.css file, where the error was a spelling error.
HomeController.Cs also had some spelling errors. I also added a return statement.
TipCalculator. Cs errors: had a few missing semicolons.

Those were the only errors I found that I debugged.
